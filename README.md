# EconomySim
This is an economy simulation coded in java. It simulates supply-demand, tax and share holding&amp;Investing.

# How it works?
Tax: You will be taxed on the amount of money you have. Some of the things that will effect your taxing is if you own shares and how much money you have stored in the bank.  

Balance: This is the money you have physically, you will be taxed for how much of it you have. You can't earn interest from it and you can't buy shares with it.  

Bank Balance: You will earn interest from this money and if the demand for a bank rises you will earn extra. You can also buy shares with the money in your bank.  

Shares: There are only a limited amount of shares(10 at the moment of speaking) the value of the shares will rise or get lower every turn, so will the shares you own.
